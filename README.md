This repository contains my attempt at replicating [Krizhevsky et al. (2012)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf). I chose AlexNet because it is a foundational paper in deep learning and replicating it would allow me to brush up on the basics and get a better grasp of what research engineering in DL looks like.

### Time spent:
- Preprocessing: 10 pomodoro sessions (~250 minutes)
